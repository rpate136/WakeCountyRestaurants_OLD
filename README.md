# WakeCountyRestaurants
Final Project for ISE 535 - Rishi Patel

In this project, I did basic analysis of data on inspection and restaurants that wake county collects. I am using pandas to do the analytics, plotly to make graphs, and dajango to run the webserver. 

The Overall Inspection page on the website is reading 420K+ rows and so will take 40-50 seconds to load depending on your processor.
